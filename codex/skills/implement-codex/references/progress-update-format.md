# Plan Progress Update Format

Use this format when updating `plan.md` during implementation.

## Task Completion

Change the task checkbox when done:

- Before: `- [ ] Add cursor parser in service`
- After: `- [x] Add cursor parser in service`

## Phase Completion

When all tasks in a phase are complete, mark the phase complete:

- Before: `### Phase 2: API Layer`
- After: `### Phase 2: API Layer (completed)`

## Mid-Execution Adjustment

If implementation reality requires adding or changing tasks:

1. Update `plan.md` first.
2. Add the new task as unchecked.
3. Implement the task.
4. Mark it complete when done.

Keep the plan artifact synchronized with implementation state at all times.
